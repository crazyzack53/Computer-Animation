    <h3>Written Description</h3>
    <p>
      The Millennium Falcon is being chased by TIE fighters after its blasters stop working while the hyperdrive is
      charging/being repaired. To lose the pursuers, the Falcon dives into an asteroid field, narrowly avoiding
      collisions and nearly clipping several asteroids before escaping.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This final animation is a short Star Wars-inspired chase sequence built around realistic lighting and physics.
      The Falcon uses the asteroid field as cover while the TIE fighters pursue, creating a sequence of near-misses
      and a narrow escape.
    </p>

    <h2>Work Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I spent a large amount of time on this project (roughly 30–50 hours total). About half of that time went into
      modeling the Millennium Falcon, plus building and texturing the asteroid field. The other half was focused on
      lighting, physics/dynamics, and camera animation. I also spent about 3–4 hours on audio/post-processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project ended up being one of the most fun assignments I’ve done in the class — I’m a big Star Wars fan,
      and I really enjoyed getting to bring my idea to life.

    <h2>Problems Encountered & How I Solved Them</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Texturing (Falcon looked flat / too clean):</strong>
        I spent a lot of time in Hypershade experimenting with nodes and combining maps until I could build a more
        weathered, believable look.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Physics issues (no collisions + gravity wouldn’t turn off):</strong>
        The solution was connecting Bullet properly to the MASH dynamics setup. After that, I could disable gravity
        and get collisions working.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Modeling challenges on the Falcon:</strong>
        Many issues came from extrusions behaving differently depending on component mode. I improved by learning when
        to select vertices vs edges vs faces before extruding/beveling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Asteroids didn’t look realistic enough:</strong>
        I added a cloud/noise-style node in the material to create a bumpier surface and break up the silhouette.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assets / Credits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>TIE Fighter model:</strong> Used one online model due to time constraints.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audio:</strong> INSERT SOURCE(S) (if any) or “Edited/mixed by me.”
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Note to Professor</h2>
    <p>
      I apologize for turning this in a bit late. I had to go home near the end of the project, and rendering took much
      longer than expected. I also ran into output issues and ended up re-rendering the animation three times to fix
      how it was coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also want to note that I used one online model (the TIE fighter) because I ran out of time to model and texture
      everything from scratch — I spent a huge portion of the time on the Millennium Falcon and wanted to make sure it
      looked as good as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I’ve had a lot of fun in this class, and this final project especially was a blast to work on.
