    <h2>Final Animation</h2>
    <p>
      The Millennium Falcon is being chased by TIE fighters while its hyperdrive is charging or being repaired.
      With its blasters offline, the Falcon flies into an asteroid field to try to lose the pursuing ships,
      narrowly avoiding impacts before making a last-second escape.

    <h2>Project Breakdown</h2>
    <p>
      I spent a significant amount of time on this project, roughly estimated between 30 and 50 hours total.
      About half of that time went into modeling the Millennium Falcon, along with building and texturing
      the asteroid field. The remaining time was focused on lighting, physics, animation, rendering,
      and post-processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rendering took a long time due to output issues, which required multiple full re-renders.
      I also spent approximately 3–4 hours on additional post-processing work, especially audio,
      to make the final result feel more cinematic and complete.
    </p>

    <h2>Problems Encountered & Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Texturing:</strong> Achieving a believable, weathered look on the Falcon was challenging.
          This was solved through extensive work in Hypershade, combining multiple texture nodes.</li>
      <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Initially, collisions did not function correctly and gravity could not be disabled.
          Connecting Bullet properly through the MASH dynamics system resolved both issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Many modeling challenges came from incorrect component selection.
          Learning when to use vertices, edges, or faces significantly improved workflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Asteroid realism:</strong> Adding a cloud node to the asteroid materials helped break up
          the surface and improve visual realism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Note to Professor</h2>
    <p>
      I apologize for turning this project in slightly late. I had to return home during the final phase,
      and rendering took longer than expected due to technical issues that required multiple re-renders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also used one online model (a TIE fighter) because I ran out of time to model and texture every asset
      from scratch. I spent a large amount of time on the Millennium Falcon and wanted to prioritize its quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have genuinely enjoyed this class, especially this project. I love Star Wars, and getting to fully
      realize this idea was extremely fun and rewarding.
